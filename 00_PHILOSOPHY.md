# SAP² — Philosophy and Methodological Stance

## Purpose of this document

This document defines the **philosophical and methodological foundations** of the SAP² project.

It exists to make explicit:
- the intellectual posture of the project,
- its boundaries,
- its assumptions,
- and its refusal to overreach.

This document should be read **before** any discussion of decoding methods or implementations.

---

## 1. Measurement is not interpretation

SAP² does not observe signals directly.
It operates exclusively on **measurements** produced by Small Audio Toolkit (SAT).

These measurements are:
- numerical,
- reproducible,
- configuration-driven,
- free of semantic intent.

SAP² does not reinterpret these measurements as meaning.
It reasons only about **structural compatibility** with known decoding methods.

---

## 2. Decodability is a structural question

SAP² treats decoding as a **structural problem**, not a semantic one.

A decoding method is considered applicable only if:
- its required input structures exist,
- those structures are sufficiently stable,
- their dimensionality matches expectations,
- ambiguity is explicitly acknowledged.

The absence of decodability is a **valid outcome**.

---

## 3. Known methods only

SAP² deliberately limits itself to:
- documented,
- historically used,
- academically described,
- or technically established decoding methods.

The project does not invent:
- new ciphers,
- speculative encodings,
- or ad-hoc interpretations.

If a decoding approach cannot be described in terms of formal inputs,
it is considered out of scope.

---

## 4. Explicit assumptions, no hidden heuristics

All reasoning steps in SAP² must be:
- explicit,
- documented,
- parameterized,
- reversible.

There are no:
- hidden thresholds,
- implicit classifications,
- silent confidence scores.

Every assumption must be inspectable.

---

## 5. Separation of roles

SAP² enforces a strict separation between:

- **Instrumentation** (Small Audio Toolkit)
- **Structural reasoning** (SAP²)
- **Interpretation and meaning** (human)

SAP² does not attempt to replace human judgment.
It exists to **constrain it**.

---

## 6. Failure is expected

SAP² assumes that, in most cases:
- no decoding method will apply,
- inputs will be insufficient,
- structures will be ambiguous.

This is not a limitation of the tool.
It is a realistic reflection of signal analysis.

Producing no result is a result.

---

## 7. Resistance to narrative bias

Humans are exceptionally good at:
- pattern recognition,
- story construction,
- retrospective justification.

SAP² is designed to **slow this process down** by:
- requiring formal inputs,
- rejecting unsupported mappings,
- documenting uncertainty.

The tool resists persuasion by structure alone.

---

## 8. White-hat posture

SAP² adopts an explicit **white-hat, methodological stance**:

- transparency over spectacle,
- falsifiability over persuasion,
- constraints over claims.

The project does not aim to:
- reveal secrets,
- prove intent,
- or validate extraordinary narratives.

It aims to clarify what can **reasonably** be attempted.

---

## 9. Ethical boundary

SAP² refuses to:
- automate interpretation,
- imply hidden communication,
- assign meaning to structure alone.

Any decoding attempt performed using SAP² outputs
remains an external, human-driven hypothesis.

Responsibility for interpretation lies entirely outside the tool.

---

## 10. Summary

SAP² is not a decoder.
It is not a detector.
It is not an oracle.

SAP² is a **constraint engine**:
it defines where decoding is plausible,
where it is unsupported,
and where it should not be attempted.

Understanding these limits is the core value of the project.
