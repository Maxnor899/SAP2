# SAP² — Future Directions

## Purpose of this document

This document outlines the **intended future directions** of SAP²,
in a way that is consistent with the project’s original ambition:

> to explore, attempt, and document **real decoding paths**  
> **when — and only when — structural conditions allow it**.

These directions are **aspirational**, not commitments.
They describe *what SAP² aims to become*, not what it currently does.

---

## 1. Decoding as a constrained experiment

SAP² is not designed to produce verdicts.
It is designed to conduct **controlled decoding experiments**.

A future version of SAP² may:
- attempt decoding using **documented methods**,
- only when required inputs are structurally present,
- with explicit parameters and assumptions.

Each decoding attempt is treated as:
- an experiment,
- reproducible,
- falsifiable,
- and explicitly bounded.

No decoding result is considered authoritative.

---

## 2. Applicability-first execution model

Decoding attempts will never be unconditional.

The execution flow is explicitly:

1. Identify candidate decoding methods  
2. Verify required input families  
3. Assess stability and ambiguity  
4. Attempt decoding only if justified  
5. Document results and limitations  

If step 2 or 3 fails, decoding is **not attempted**.

This preserves methodological rigor while allowing real exploration.

---

## 3. Multiple decoding paths in parallel

When several decoding methods are structurally compatible,
SAP² may attempt **multiple decodings in parallel**.

In such cases:
- no ranking is performed,
- no convergence is assumed,
- results are presented side by side.

Disagreement between decoding outputs is treated as information,
not as a problem to be resolved automatically.

---

## 4. Decoding failure as an explained outcome

When a decoding attempt fails, SAP² does not fail silently.

Future versions may produce:
- explicit failure diagnostics,
- instability reports,
- under-constrained warnings,
- parameter sensitivity analyses.

Failure is documented as a **technical outcome**, not an error.

---

## 5. Decoding inputs as first-class artifacts

SAP² may generate and expose intermediate decoding inputs:

- event series
- interval distributions
- symbolic sequences
- band-wise feature vectors
- time–frequency representations

These artifacts are:
- versioned,
- inspectable,
- reusable,
- independent of final interpretation.

They exist to support human analysis as much as automated reasoning.

---

## 6. Decoding as hypothesis, not conclusion

Every decoding attempt is treated as a **hypothesis**:

- tied to specific assumptions,
- dependent on explicit parameters,
- invalidated if conditions change.

SAP² does not validate hypotheses.
It documents them.

Meaning, intent, and relevance remain human responsibilities.

---

## 7. Human-in-the-loop by design

SAP² is intentionally not autonomous.

Future designs may:
- allow users to select decoding families,
- adjust discretization strategies,
- explore alternative parameterizations.

SAP² assists exploration.
It does not replace judgment.

---

## 8. Compatibility beyond SAT

While SAP² is designed around Small Audio Toolkit outputs,
future versions may accept compatible inputs from:

- alternative measurement pipelines,
- historical datasets,
- synthetic or simulated signals.

Compatibility is defined by **input grammar**, not by tool origin.

---

## 9. Explicitly out of scope

SAP² will not evolve toward:

- automatic message detection,
- probabilistic claims of hidden content,
- semantic interpretation,
- narrative generation,
- intent inference.

These are not deferred features.
They are explicit exclusions.

---

## 10. Summary

SAP² aims to become an **experimental decoding framework**:

- cautious, but not passive,
- exploratory, but not speculative,
- capable of real decoding attempts,
- without ever claiming authority over meaning.

Its value lies not in what it reveals,
but in **how clearly it shows what was attempted, why, and with what limits**.
